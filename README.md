# ChatGPT responses workflow model support

This extension was updated to `Responses` API https://doc.livehelperchat.com/docs/bot/chatgpt-responses

With this extension you won't need to pay anything to third party except OpenAI for contextual search based on your personal data. Streaming is also supported!

For those setups samples you don't need to setup extension

Differences between those API - https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions It is recommended just to use `Responses` API

* Responses API sample setup - https://doc.livehelperchat.com/docs/bot/chatgpt-responses
* Completions API sample setup - https://doc.livehelperchat.com/docs/bot/chatgpt-integration
* Assistant API is depreciated, but you can look at this sample - https://youtu.be/SEsOjmoKdrI

## Requirements

* Min 4.52v Live Helper Chat version.
* Polling/Streaming workflow is supported only.
* Account at https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview
* `System configuration -> Live Help Configuration -> Chat configuration -> Misc` Make sure you unheck `Reopen chat functionality enabled` and `Allow user to reopen closed chats?`. This is required because if chat is reopened we can be in the middle of previous task.
* `gpt-4o-mini` Model is used.
* The Account is funded with 5$. Sometimes there were reports that some users were getting `404` during API calls.

### Demo

* You can see ChatGPT chat running on https://doc.livehelperchat.com/ it can answer questions only related to Live Helper Chat documentation. Demo also supports streaming.
* For facebook demo look at https://www.facebook.com/LiveHelperChat/ and write message to messenger :)

We are using for this demo https://livehelperchat.com/order/now if you want easily setup your own bot.

* For streaming demo look at https://youtu.be/9clxMjnrGsM
* For setup from scratch without extension, look at https://youtu.be/SEsOjmoKdrI
* For setup on facebook messenger look at https://youtu.be/nIExwuWeb3E

How it works?

* Account at https://platform.openai.com is created
* Background worker is used https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/lhc-php-resque
* To vector store files from https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/doc were uploaded

### How to generate content for your own knowledge base?

Demo bot is using documentation generated from this command. Take a look at official documentation of the tool at https://github.com/obeone/crawler-to-md It generated md file which later was uploaded at https://platform.openai.com

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output -v $(pwd)/cache:/app/cache remdex/crawler-to-md --url https://doc.livehelperchat.com --exclude "/docs/hooks"
```

I have created fork also which fixes few things like absolute links and code tags parsing.

Or just run. Modify to your needs. `--exclude` part is optional

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output -v $(pwd)/cache:/app/cache remdex/crawler-to-md --url https://doc.livehelperchat.com --exclude "/docs/hooks"
```

Build from source
```
git clone https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/crawler-to-md.git && cd crawler-to-md
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t crawler-to-md .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output -v $(pwd)/cache:/app/cache crawler-to-md --url https://doc.livehelperchat.com --exclude "/docs/hooks"
```

#### How to call a trigger based on defined function in ChatGPT?

1. Notice defined function name E.g `transfer_operator`
2. Add [event](bot/triggers.md) to your trigger with `Type` of `Custom text matching` where `Should include any of these words` value should be `transfer_operator`. Screenshot can be found [here](https://doc.livehelperchat.com/docs/bot/chatgpt-integration#how-to-call-a-trigger-based-on-defined-function-in-chatgpt)

### Present release
